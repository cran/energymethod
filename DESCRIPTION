Description: Given two samples of size n_1 and n_2 from a data set where each sample consists of K functional observations (channels), each recorded on T grid points,  the function energy method implements a hypothesis test of equality of channel-wise mean at each channel using the bootstrapped distribution of maximum energy to control family wise error.
